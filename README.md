# IMDB-Text-Classification
This project demonstrates a basic text classification model for analyzing the sentiment of movie reviews. It is designed as a foundational project for aspiring LLM (Large Language Model), showcasing key techniques like data preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, and training a Logistic Regression classifier.
# Introduction
#### This project, IMDB-Text-Classification, is a beginner-friendly implementation of a sentiment analysis system. It classifies movie reviews as either positive or negative using a basic Logistic Regression model. The dataset consists of 10 manually created movie reviews, making it an excellent starting point for anyone exploring text classification and sentiment analysis.

# The project highlights essential machine learning steps such as:
#### 1.Text preprocessing: Removing stopwords and vectorizing text using TF-IDF.
#### 2.Model training: Using Logistic Regression for classification.
#### 3.Evaluation: Measuring model performance with accuracy and a classification report.
